# Create tools for the Processing open source programming language and 
# environment (http://www.processing.org)
#
# Create a copy of this file named "local.properties" and customize the properties to 
# make the ant-build-process work for your environment.
# How? Please read the comments below.
#
# The default properties are set for OSX, for Windows-settings please refer to 
# comments made under (1) and (2).


# (1) 
# Where is your Processing sketchbook located? 
# If you are not sure, check the sketchbook location in your Processing 
# application preferences.
# ${user.home} points the compiler to your home directory.
# For windows the default path to your sketchbook would be
# ${user.home}/My Documents/Processing (make adjustments below).

sketchbook.location=${user.home}/Documents/Processing



# (2) 
# Where are the jar files located that are required for compiling your tool such
# as e.g. core.jar?
# By default the local classpath location points to folder libs inside Eclipse's
# workspace (by default found in your home directory).
# For Windows the default path would be ${user.home}/workspace/libs (make 
# adjustments below).

#classpath.local.location=${user.home}/Documents/workspace/libs


# For OSX users. 
# The following path will direct you into Processing's application source code 
# folder in case you put Processing inside your Applications folder. 
# Uncommenting the line below will overwrite the classpath.local.location from 
# above.

classpath.local.location=/Applications/Processing.app/Contents/Resources/Java/core/library/


# Add all jar files that are required for compiling your project to the local 
# and project classpath, use a comma as delimiter. These jar files must be 
# inside your classpath.local.location folder.
#
# For creating a tool, both pde.jar and core.jar are required. (pde.jar should 
# then be located inside folder classpath.local.location). 
# The best practice would be to place both, core.jar and pde.jar into your local
# classpath location.

classpath.local.include=core.jar,pde.jar


# Add processing's libraries folder to the classpath.
# If you don't need to include the libraries folder to your classpath, comment 
# out the following line.

classpath.libraries.location=${sketchbook.location}/libraries
