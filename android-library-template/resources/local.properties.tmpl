# Create Android libraries for the Processing open source programming language and 
# environment (http://www.processing.org)
#
# Create a copy of this file named "local.properties" and customize the properties to 
# make the ant-build-process work for your environment.
# How? Please read the comments below.
#
# The default properties are set for OSX, for Windows-settings please refer to 
# comments made under (1) and (2).



# (1) 
# Where is your Processing sketchbook located?
# If you are not sure, check the sketchbook location in your Processing 
# application preferences.
# 
# ${user.home} points the compiler to your home directory.
# For windows the default path to your sketchbook would be
# ${user.home}/My Documents/Processing (make adjustments below).

sketchbook.location=${user.home}/Documents/Processing



# (2) 
# Where are the core library files located that are required for compiling
# your library such as e.g. core.jar or android-core.zip?
# By default the local classpath location points to folder libs inside Eclipse's
# workspace (by default found in your home directory).
# For Windows the default path would be ${user.home}/workspace/libs (make 
# adjustments below).

#classpath.local.location=${user.home}/Documents/workspace/libs


# For OSX users. 
# The following path will direct you into Processing's application source code 
# folder in case you put Processing inside your Applications folder. 
# Uncommenting the line below will overwrite the classpath.local.location from 
# above.

classpath.local.location=/Applications/Processing.app/Contents/Resources/Java/modes/android/


# Add the Processing Android Core file (android-core.zip) that is required for
# compiling your project to the local and project classpath. This file must be
# inside your classpath.local.location folder.

classpath.local.include=android-core.zip



# Android Platform
# The following paths point to the location of the version of android.jar
# required to build your project. As of Processing 2.0a6, API Level 10 is the
# minimum version, but your library may require a higher level if it includes
# newer features like NFC or Wi-Fi direct.

# android_platform.location is dependent on where you installed the Android SDK

android_platform.location=${user.home}/android-sdk-macosx/platforms/android-10/

# android_platform.include will probably always be android.jar

android_platform.include=android.jar


# Add processing's libraries folder to the classpath.
# If you don't need to include any installed libraries in the classpath, change
# this to a path that does not exist (but note that it will be created during
# the build).

classpath.libraries.location=${sketchbook.location}/libraries
